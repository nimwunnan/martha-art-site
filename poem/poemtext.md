  
Perchance when you are wandering forth 1829
Most poet-like where brooks and flowery weeds 1835
resist ubiquitous entropy in 2016
a wary re-enactment of the past. 2020
beauty's pleasurable affirmation 2016
Of thy new paradise, extended, 1806
Placeless, as spirits, one soft water-sun 1802
Keeps record of the trophies won from thee,
no cloud must come between your eyes and (this) 1956
ruthless and brilliant intensity 2009

“Our relationship to landscape is not 2021
Of mouldering leaves in the waste wilderness:— 1816
it has the force of law, a norm against 2009
a representation of something that 2002
promises it isn’t ready to keep. 2018
Yet the lost fragments shall remain, 1829
interacting, and you are one of them.” 2021

And soon the fragments dim of lovely forms 1809
​​Blew mimic hootings to the silent owls 1800
Buried beneath the glittering Lake! 1829
And like as though the plague became a guest, 1835
unlike a toxic owl signalling 2020
for its reflection, only to find none. 2009
the play between the original and
original and copy, copy and 2018
hesitation between an obscure source 2009
and the fiery heart of the liquid. 1956
copy, and copy and simulacrum 2018
those hidden are reflected in the Lake 1794
With its soft neighbourhood of filmy clouds, 1802

Once did I see a slip of earth, 1829
immediately comprehensible 2021
'Tis strange there was one only cypress tree, 1826
He like her shadow has pursued, where'er 1816
her body does not continue under 2008
silicon jungles lattices of light, 2016
The eloquent blood told an ineffable tale. 1816
 a deep shimmering crimson in colour. 1956
Untwist her beauteous web, disrobe her charms, 1773
to tear to pieces the aesthetic screen 2009
a groundless existence entails loving 2016
without dispelling their mystery. 2021

And I'll contrive a sylvan room
I'll dress the sand rock cave for you, 1807
I hear her voice — thy "sunny dome”, 1797
Behold'st her shadow still abiding there, 1802
Lured by the gentle meaning of his looks, 1816
without repugnance fancy trees talking 1677
Hoping to still these obstinate questionings 1816
observe him with a familiar gaze. 1861
Thou hast unveiled thy inmost sanctuary, 1816
Loosed from its hold; — how no one knew 1829
Leaving a houseless home, a ruined nest— 1835
whereby subjectivity defines itself 2016
one thought is limited by another. 1677

---

precisely this emphasis on mastery, 
identified with scientific knowledge
disposition toward what he calls 'novelty,' 
never quite accomplishes … paradise.” 2016
To keep the relique? 'twill but idly feed 1802
retroactive former stability 2020

An early worshipper at Nature's shrine; 1807
Of whom we read, the man whom we behold 1850
(Describing Arcady) "I would recline; 1807 
The awful ruins of the days of old: 1816 

---
The portal, and the ruin'd battlements; 1807
And wall impregnable of beaming ice. 1817 
The mind is lord and master - outward sense 1850
'Bathes' us in potential paradise.” 2009

---
Gaze on the empty scene as vacantly 1816
Unfinish'd sentences, or half erased,1807
How well the narrator imparts immediacy!” 2009
To furnish food for fickle taste. 1800

---

In progress through this Verse, my mind hath looked: 1850
Not because the chain hangs from a transcendental hook 2018

Environment is a transcendent sign, 2017
the shadow tethered in the reader’s mind, 2021
nature's manifold otherness is not 2016
a mere empty placeholder for a host…
"So 'nature' occupies at least three places 2009
Smaller in magnitude, yet all the greater 2021
magical forms of differentiation 2009
comprehended and understood at once.1810
all the objects on the opposite Coast 1794
Like vaporous shapes half seen; beyond, a well,
Dark, gleaming, and of most translucent wave, 1816
in an epistemological sea,… 2009

---

The glorious lightning of the kindled eye, 1825
an inauthentic imaginary 2021
superstition, struck deep roots in their minds 1677
where the root base of a large tree had once been. 2021
No myrtle-walks are these: these are no groves 1802
Among them may be heard the stranger's songs. 1807
but when the poet finally hears the voice 
“The Trees”, whose thoughts are so “vague” and “fragmented,” 2017
starts to follow him across the landscape. 2021
this new ventriloquial arrangement 
incapable of transmuted impact 2020
at once appreciative and naïve, 2021
converting its 'companionable' forms
in opposition to what it is not." 2016

Man walks through these forests of symbols which 1845
I consciously have injured, but still loved 1816
and then tried to construct some point of view 2021
a foundation for transcendental ‘truth,' 2016
As an invisible world--unheard, unseen, 1802
A hole, or gap, … opened up by the image; 2021
yet shifting …like an old fashioned cranky 2021
set pieces, artifice, and layers of 2021
a world that mirrors our reality 2019
Of light and odour — the rich violets 1825
Each wildflower on the marge inverted there, 1802
underwritten by a more threatening void, 2009
representative of no setting at all. 2021

>
there is a blankness that is structural 2009
of crystal-clear glass, thin as a bubble 1956
The pool becomes a mirror; and behold 1802
an illusory window into depth 2003
As ocean's moon looks on the moon in heaven. 1816

Nature is a temple where living columns 1845
Come trembling back, unite, and now once more 1802
reflection then dissolves … tranquility 2009
A strabismus that enables wilfully 2020
the gazing subject's vulnerability
erased in this vision of unity. 2016

---

My voice sound(s) like I read a lot of books, 
loving descriptions of works that deploy 2021
utopian possibilities built 2018
To fertilize some other ground. 1829
The spatial distance required for this 
profitable transformation of nature 2016
is thought to sit sideways to … narrative. 2009
There is no “outside”—just the entire 
vast network of interpenetrating 2021
'clearings' through which we glimpse the wonder of 2016
this figure, a shadow double of himself, 2021
Genius of heav'n-taught poesy! 1800

---

Just as snow makes us painfully aware 2009
paved surfaces, … absorb and radiate 2020
Switzerland seen through a lessening lens; 1879
of solid gold, wrought in …exquisite patterns 1956
Resembling writing scrawls which fancy reads 1835
yet is not certain that it is not false! 1677
Representation might, in editing,
be transported anywhere any moment,  2018
men are formed from stones as well as from seed, 1677
entities that come to know one another
missing something in the confrontation, 2021
their bearings and relations to each other, 1810
refined into ever increasing self 2016
Each in the other lost and found: and see 1802
the mere appearance of infinity. 1798

---

Up close, it’s a series of electronic 
particles, but as we step backward, 2019
bits of artistic detritus spills through 2021
reason's 'autonomy' acquires a
Melancholy that replays tragic loss 2016 
when these components are animated,
one term of which is always valorized 2016
simulacra liberates his vision. 2021

---

"Uncanny how often we see this pattern,” 2020

When night makes a weird sound of its own stillness, 1816
the Lyulph's Tower gleams like a Ghost,
now the Shadow is suddenly gone—and 1827
The stains and shadings of forgotten tears, 1802
suspect in their attempt to smooth over 2009
the dignity of the unacquainted 1798
excluded in our view of the picture: 2009
A curious picture, with a master's haste
Sketched on a strip of pinky-silver skin, 1802

---

you have before you a flagon of wine. 1956
Thy " caves of ice" aloud repeat — 1800
more ominously potent fantasies; 2016
The thrilling secrets of the birth of time 
Hang their mute thoughts on the mute walls around, 1816
an unqualified restoration of 2016
an atmosphere of emotions was evoked. 2021

---

Yet in the sweetest places cometh ill, 1835
aesthetics of landscape, framed or staged for
the chance to experience the rugged 2021
deflated concept which mostly exists 2019
to see. Language helps cut through, and reveal; 2021
Conceals. Among the ruined temples there, 1816
eccentric mountains in miniature 2021
The fountains of divine philosophy 1816
That murmurs with a dead, yet tinkling sound;
Delicious to the soul, but fleeting, vain. 1802
Rapt in the visionary theme,
Thou bid'st a new creation rise,
Of thy rich paradise, extended,
Proving the wondrous witcheries of song! 1800

---

"Rendering practices risk forgetting 2009
aesthetic politics of the rhizome 2009
the full realization that you’ll always 2021
not observe the constructed scene alone: 2021
The visions will return! And lo! he stays: 1802
E'en as that phantom-world on which he gazed,

---

We should just open our eyes and ears more– 2009It was a mouth the rose had lean'd to kiss. 1825
You have two goblets before you. One is 1956
a version of the aesthetic sublime
turned sweet, while the pastoral, with its lakes 1956
Vanishes, and a thousand circlets spread, 1802
And the green earth lost in his heart its claims. 1816
Needs must the pathway turn, that leads straightway: 1802
Truth can have no being outside the mind 1677
As … concepts transpose to the digital, 2021
combustions, cross-weavings, and “ignitions” 2017
hesitation in systems of meaning 2009
Were so ethereal in bloom and breath: 1825

---

And rhapsodies like this, were sometimes found— 1807

---

Poet of Nature, thou hast wept to know 1816
that whose nature cannot be conceived 1677 
In the world's wilderness, with want or woe— 1807
first words spoke man and woman and believed 2000 

---
the subject is "this," "over here," inside 2009
Confederate, imitative of the chace 1850
The object is "that," "over there," outside 2009
Utopian face of abstract value, space 2009

---
Nature's vast frame, the web of human things, 1816
Make net-work of the dark blue light of day, 1816 
indeterminacy in time's unfoldings” 2016
& in a moment all is snatched away 1800

---


The groundless subject ignores inequities 2018 
in the flow of time these copies are copies of copies.” 1993

---

Deluded research only capable
of looking into present danger as 2020
an embodiment of a hyper one; 2019
future structures the past, injecting an 2016
abandonment of the deeper states within: 2020
body cannot be limited by… thought, 1677
in the living being as a whole, they 2016
are more deeply intertwined than (once) thought,”  2021
But would be something that he knows not of. 1802
And since they had never heard anything 
about the temperament of these rulers,1677
Are we thus condemned to insanity? 2009

---

“Beyond” is not hidden within the depths 2017
'Tis scarcely deep enough a bee to drown, 1835
Since finitude is … partial nega­tion, 1677
Of thy new paradise, extended,1800
Perhaps the (present) absence of context 2021
is already a representation; 2018
the creation of stupefying awe; 2016
higher meaning to the ordinary; 1798
the order of temporal unfolding– 2016
is a reason why we can cast an eye. 2021
And suddenly, as one that toys with time, 1802
Without an object, hope, or fear, 1832
its own self-definition 2020
Scatters them on the pool! Then all the charm
Is broken--all that phantom world so fair 1802
to our accepting of the illusion. 2009

---

And thus through many seasons’ space 1832
As nature's poesy and pastoral spells—1835
And hunt her to her elemental forms… 1773
a potentially infinite series 2009
Of my song died away amid the hills, 1825
Its place no longer to be found, 1832
